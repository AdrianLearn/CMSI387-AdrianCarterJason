Comments:
---------

Nice work!  Just a couple of comments:

Your Dining Phil's works OK, but it stops when it shouldn't.  The idea is
for the program to run and keep running unless there is deadlock which
would cause it to "hang".  Yours also leaves p[4] running when everyone
else has exited.  Still, you earn nearly full credit.

On problem 3, it didn't compile on Windows.  Moved to Mac.  No joy there
either.  Sorry, no credit earned on that one.

Problem 4 compiles on Mac, not on Windows, so I tried running it on Mac.
I created a testfile.txt document for it to read, but the program can't
open the file.  It does run, though, just doesn't do what it's supposed to
do.  Most of the credit is earned for this one.

RE-EVALUATED AFTER POSTING UPDATE FOR PROBLEM #3

All good now!  Full credit earned.
See updated scores below.

SEMESTER SO FAR, COMING UP TO FINAL EXAM:
   homework01:  12/12 = 100.00% of 10 pts = 10.00 pts
   homework02:  97/97 = 100.00% of 10 pts = 10.00 pts
   homework03:  76/80 =  95.00% of 10 pts =  9.50 pts
        total:                              29.50 pts out of 30.00
                        which is 98.33% which is an A-plus

Get back to me with a working program for problem 3 and I'll re-evaluate to
get you some more points on this one.
