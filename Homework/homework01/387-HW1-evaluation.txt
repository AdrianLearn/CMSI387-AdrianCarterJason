Thanks for your inputs!!  All three of these are interesting topics, and I
shall do my best to include more information about each of the three as the

Nice presentation on the Gantt chart.  I like the use of color, which makes
things very clear.  Oh, and nice formatting in the markdown, too!

Excellent work!
