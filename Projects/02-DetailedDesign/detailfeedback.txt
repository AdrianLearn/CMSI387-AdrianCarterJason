modified "df" command ~ storage breakdown visualization

I'm really looking forward to this one!  Having something like this in Linux
has been needed for a while, IMHO.

On your diagram, did you intentionally omit the text in the legend?  It sort
of looks like there was something intended to be there, otherwise it just
looks like "raspberry red, lemon yellow, and orange orange"... *grin*

Interesting way, though, to highlight the different command switches you'll
be using/profiding!  I like it......

This will be very cool to see when you demo it!

Semester so far:
   homework01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   homework02  90.0% * 10 points =  9.00 points
   delivery01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery02 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                          total:   39.00 out of 40 = 97.50% which is an A-plus

Keep up the great work, you three!
