new command ~ storage breakdown visualization

This is an interesting idea!  It's not really a kernel modification though.
If you can find a way to make sure it integrates tightly with some kernel
functions or make it work as one of the common utilities package, then this
will be a VERY cool project.

It is gonna be difficult, though, because of the gui-driven nature of the
display.  Making windows pop up and then displaying things in them can be a
beast to get working properly.

Still, I don't want to rain on your parade, and I'm sure that the three of
you can pull it off!

Looks like the "modules" you are listing are really directories where these
various parts of the system are located.  That's not *quite* what is meant by
the term "modules", but it's a good start.

This will be very cool to see when you demo it!

Semester so far:
   homework01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                          total:   20.00 out of 20 = 100.0% which is an A-plus

Keep up the great work, you two!
