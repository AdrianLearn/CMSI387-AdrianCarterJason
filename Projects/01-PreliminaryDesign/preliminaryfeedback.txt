new command ~ random terminal command explanation

This is an interesting idea!  Providing the terminal user with information
about a "random" command can help the novice and even the experienced user
to learn new things about the operations available from the command line!

This will be very cool to see when you demo it!

Semester so far:
   homework01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                          total:   20.00 out of 20 = 100.0% which is an A-plus

Keep up the great work, you two!
